# Mirza Muhammad Naseer

## About
I am a dedicated PhD researcher and part-time lecturer at Teesside University International Business School, specializing in climate change, corporate social responsibility, and green finance. My research primarily examines how climate risks impact firm value, market volatility, and ESG performance. With a solid background in finance and econometrics, I have developed expertise in advanced analytical techniques to investigate these complex interactions.
Throughout my academic journey, I have received numerous accolades for my commitment to multidisciplinary research and for my contributions to prestigious journals such as the International Review of Financial Analysis, Finance Research Letters and Research in International Business and Finance. In addition to my academic pursuits, I also have professional experience in financial management, where I have honed my skills in strategic planning and financial forecasting.
