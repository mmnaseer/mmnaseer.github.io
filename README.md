# Minimal single-page academic site (Sorace-like)

This is an original, minimal single-page template with a simple list navigation and clean typography,
designed for GitHub Pages.

## Publish
Upload all files to the root of your `mmnaseer.github.io` repository and ensure Pages deploys from `main` and `/(root)`.

## Edit
- `index.html`: your content and links
- `FILES/CV.pdf`: replace with your CV (keep name)
- `assets/style.css`: colors/typography
